# EAAD
A code editor specially built for editing SCE files made to be compiled with Avenuras AD's DAAD text game maker.

EAAD takes .SCE files made for DAAD and shows them sepearating sections in tabs, ando also using syntax hightlight in the processes tabs. Files are readed and saved using ancient DOS encoding, to allow DAAD compiler (a DOS executable) handle accented chars and other special symbols properly.

EAAD has been forked from ngPAWS editor, so cleary ressembles it.
